  * Take advantage of React features to eliminate code repetition and make site more easily maintainable.

  * Design my own unique portfolio page
  * Display polished projects that have Readmes
  * Include contact information
  * Introduce myself. Talk about my interests and why I enjoy coding.

## Project Features
* Single page with 3 sections. Navigation links to each section in header.
* Expandible 'About Me' section with animation on open/close button. (Shows 1 paragraph. Expands to 3.)
* Each project is displayed on a card with the following information:
  - A screenshot of the app
  - A brief description of the app
  - A list of technology used with links to information about each technology.
  - A brief description of my role in the project
  - Links to the GitHub repo, the deployed application, and an HTML version of the Readme
* The site is fully mobile responsive.

## Technologies Used
